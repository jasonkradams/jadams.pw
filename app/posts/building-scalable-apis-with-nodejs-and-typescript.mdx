# Building Scalable APIs with Node.js and TypeScript

In this article, we'll explore how to architect robust backend services using modern JavaScript technologies and best practices for production environments.

## Why Node.js + TypeScript?
Node.js offers a non-blocking, event-driven architecture that's ideal for scalable APIs. TypeScript adds static typing, improved tooling, and better maintainability.

## Key Topics
- Project structure for scalability
- Type safety and DTOs
- Express.js with TypeScript
- Error handling and validation
- Testing strategies
- Production deployment tips

## Example: Express.js API with TypeScript
```ts
import express from 'express';
import type { Request, Response } from 'express';

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.get('/api/hello', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello, world!' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('API running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

## Best Practices
- Use environment variables for config
- Validate all input (e.g. with zod or joi)
- Write integration and unit tests
- Use Docker for local dev and deployment
- Monitor with tools like Prometheus/Grafana

## Conclusion
Node.js and TypeScript are a powerful combo for building scalable APIs. With the right structure and practices, you can deliver robust, maintainable, and production-ready services.
